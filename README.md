Any code you see is from my colleges classes as I take them. They are codes that are done as projects or just in class assignments. I do plan on putting personal projects that I will be working on in here too. Take a look! 
UPDATE: This was my first time using Github, since then I have learned a bit more and have seperate repositories for different projects.
