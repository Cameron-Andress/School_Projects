- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cameron-Andress
- 👀 I’m interested in Videogame Design and anything in the field of Astronomy. Whether it be cosmology, astrophysics, astrobiology, ect. I am always ready to learn and discuss about it and help out as much as possible. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Engineering and Astrophysics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Astronomy Projects or videogame projects. I am very interested in both subjects and want to help out and learn a lot more along the way.

- Any code you see is from my colleges classes as I take them. They are codes that are done as projects or just in class assignments. I do plan on putting personal projects that I will be working on in here too. Take a look!
